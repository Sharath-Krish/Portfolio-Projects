# Portfolio-Project using Python on FLIPKART Dataset

Introduction- Flipkart a leading Ecommerce platform in india which is also known as indian amazon. 

Objective- The available dataset of flipkart needs to be analysed and visualised for understanding the sale pattern & product  portfolio based on customer experience & feedback.

Observations- Brand,Price column has null values.
            - No duplicate values found in the dataset
            - No sales data found for jul to nov.
            - Sales in the month of Dec & Jan are highest and Feb & May.
            - The categories with the most sales were clothing (women's), electronics, jewellery and automotive.
            - Top sub-categories are women's clothing,men's clothing and Necklaces & Chains.
            - 'None' values are more often found in tertiary & quaternary category which gives lesser insight.
            
Conclusion   - Few null values in sale price & discount price were found which are replaced with the median values.
               - Sales data is available for 7months & hence doesn't provide much insights.
               - Women's western wear is the top selling product & needs more option to be added in the womens portfolio.
               - Automotive, electronics, accessories and clothing held the highest discounts. To boost the sale, additional
                 discount on creditcard,combo purchases,gifts-coupons and extension of sale events can be planned.
